"1.  A finished admission episode (FAE) is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FAEs are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.",,,,,,,,,,,
2.  The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and 7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.,,,,,,,,,,,
3.  ICD-10 Codes: E66 - Obesity.,,,,,,,,,,,
4.  Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data.,,,,,,,,,,,
"5.  Counts include people resident in English Strategic Health Authorites (SHAs) only, including admissions where the SHA of residence was England but not further specified and excludes admissions where the SHA of residence was unknown.",,,,,,,,,,,
6. Total includes admissions where the gender was unknown or not specified.,,,,,,,,,,,
7. The quality and coverage of HES data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.,,,,,,,,,,,
"8.  The data presented in this report are for inpatients only, so does not reflect all hospital activity. This should be considered when interpreting the data as practice may vary over time and between regions. In particular, practices vary between hospitals as to whether some bariatric procedures are carried out in outpatient or inpatient settings. This may particularly be the case for maintenance procedures. OPCS-4.5 introduced a specific code for maintenance of gastric band. OPCS-4.5 was introduced in 2009/10. Inconsistencies in the use of this code may have contributed to the decrease seen this year and the increases seen from 2009/10. This is apparent for one hospital site in particular, Royal Derby Hospital, which has an impact (mainly) on the figures for East Midlands Strategic Health Authority and the residing Primary Care Trusts, but also the national figures. See Appendix A for further detail on HES.  ",,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, practices vary between hospitals as to whether some bariatric procedures are carried out in outpatient or inpatient settings. This may particularly be the case for maintenance procedures. OPCS-4.5 introduced a specific code for maintenance of gastric band. OPCS-4.5 was introduced in 2009/10. Inconsistencies in the use of this code may have contributed to the decrease seen this year and the increases seen from 2009/10. This is apparent for one hospital site in particular, Royal Derby Hospital, which has an impact (mainly) on the figures for East Midlands Strategic Health Authority and the residing Primary Care Trusts, but also the national figures.

These figures represent the number of episodes where the procedure (or intervention) was recorded in any of the 24 (12 from 2002/03 to 2006/07 and 4 prior to 2002/03) operative procedure fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. A record is only included once in each count, even if the procedure is recorded in more than one operative procedure field of the record. Please note that more procedures are carried out than episodes with a main or secondary procedure.  For example, patients under going a ‘cataract operation’ would tend to have at least two procedures – removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new one – counted in a single episode.",,,,,,,,,,,
"5. The term 'bariatric surgery' is often used to define a group of procedures that can be performed to facilitate weight loss although these procedures can be performed for conditions other than weight loss.  It includes stomach stapling, gastric bypasses and sleeve gastrectomy. The procedures for tables 7.7 and 7.8  show the defined range of procedures when a corresponding main diagnosis of Obesity (ICD10-E66) is also present. Definition of codes can be found in Appendix B.",,,,,,,,,,,
"6. From 2012/13 the list of OPCS 4.6 codes used to define “bariatric surgery” has been amended in line with the methodology used by Health Resource Groups (HRGs) this is covered in more detail in the Methodological Change Note http://www.hscic.gov.uk/media/13556/Statistics-on-Obesity-Physical-Activity-and-Diet-England-2014/pdf/MethChange201402_SOPAD.pdf 
This definitional change has a minimal effect on previous years’ data; between 20 and 30 cases a year from 2009/10 onwards when OPCS 4.5 and 4.6 codes were used, following on from the introduction of a specific code for maintenance of gastric band in OPCS-4.5 in 2009/10. All OPCS-4.2, OPCS-4.3, OPCS-4.4, OPCS-4.5 and OPCS-4.6 procedure codes used to define bariatric surgery are described in Appendix B.",,,,,,,,,,,

9. Total includes episodes where the gender was unknown or not specified.,,,,,,,,,,,
10. The quality and coverage of HES data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.,,,,,,,,,,,

This may particularly be the case for maintenance procedures. OPCS-4.5 introduced a specific code for maintenance of gastric band. OPCS-4.5 was introduced in 2009/10. Inconsistencies in the use of this code may have contributed to the decrease seen this year and the increases seen from 2009/10. This is apparent for one hospital site in particular, Royal Derby Hospital, which has an impact (mainly) on the figures for East Midlands Strategic Health Authority and the residing Primary Care Trusts, but also the national figures.

"1.  A finished consultant episode (FCE) is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.",,,,,,,,,,,
2. The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and 7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.,,,,,,,,,,,
3. ICD-10 Codes: E66 - Obesity.,,,,,,,,,,,
"4. These figures represent the number of episodes where the procedure (or intervention) was recorded in any of the 24 (12 from 2002/03 to 2006/07 and 4 prior to 2002/03) operative procedure fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. A record is only included once in each count, even if the procedure is recorded in more than one operative procedure field of the record. Please note that more procedures are carried out than episodes with a main or secondary procedure.  For example, patients under going a ‘cataract operation’ would tend to have at least two procedures – removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new one – counted in a single episode.",,,,,,,,,,,
"5. The term 'bariatric surgery' is often used to define a group of procedures that can be performed to facilitate weight loss although these procedures can be performed for conditions other than weight loss.  It includes stomach stapling, gastric bypasses and sleeve gastrectomy. The procedures for tables 7.7 and 7.8  show the defined range of procedures when a corresponding main diagnosis of Obesity (ICD10-E66) is also present. Definition of codes can be found in Appendix B.",,,,,,,,,,,
"6. From 2012/13 the list of OPCS 4.6 codes used to define “bariatric surgery” has been amended in line with the methodology used by Health Resource Groups (HRGs) this is covered in more detail in the Methodological Change Note http://www.hscic.gov.uk/media/13556/Statistics-on-Obesity-Physical-Activity-and-Diet-England-2014/pdf/MethChange201402_SOPAD.pdf 
This definitional change has a minimal effect on previous years’ data; between 20 and 30 cases a year from 2009/10 onwards when OPCS 4.5 and 4.6 codes were used, following on from the introduction of a specific code for maintenance of gastric band in OPCS-4.5 in 2009/10. All OPCS-4.2, OPCS-4.3, OPCS-4.4, OPCS-4.5 and OPCS-4.6 procedure codes used to define bariatric surgery are described in Appendix B.",,,,,,,,,,,
7. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data.,,,,,,,,,,,
"8. Counts include people resident in English Strategic Health Authorites (SHA) only, including admissions where the SHA of residence was England but not further specified and excludes admissions where the SHA of residence was unknown.",,,,,,,,,,,

This should be considered when interpreting the data as practice may vary over time and between regions. In particular, practices vary between hospitals as to whether some bariatric procedures are carried out in outpatient or inpatient settings. This may particularly be the case for maintenance procedures. OPCS-4.5 introduced a specific code for maintenance of gastric band. OPCS-4.5 was introduced in 2009/10. Inconsistencies in the use of this code may have contributed to the decrease seen this year and the increases seen from 2009/10.

1.  Prescriptions are written on a prescription form known as a FP10. Each single item written on the form is counted as a prescription item.,,,,,,,,,,,
"2.  Net Ingredient Cost (NIC) is the basic cost of a drug. It does not take account of discounts, dispensing costs, fees or prescription charge income.",,,,,,,,,,,
"3.  This information was obtained from the Prescribing Analysis and Cost Tool  (PACT) system, which covers prescriptions prescribed by GPs, nurses, pharmacists and others in England and dispensed in the community in the UK. Prescriptions written in hospitals /clinics that are dispensed in the community, prescriptions dispensed in hospitals, dental prescribing and private prescriptions are not included in PACT data. ",,,,,,,,,,,
4.  Prescriptions written in England but dispensed outside England are included.,,,,,,,,,,,
"5.  Rimonabant was only available on prescription from July 2006, therefore figures for Rimonbant in 2006 only reflect six months worth of data.",,,,,,,,,,,
"6. On 16th January 2009, the European Commission issued a decision to withdraw the marketing authorisation for Rimonabant (Acomplia) following an assessment of the benefits and risks of taking this medicine.",,,,,,,,,,,
7.  Up until 2007 'total' included other drugs that may be used to treat obesity which include Phentermine and Diethylpropion Hydrochloride.,,,,,,,,,,,
"8. On 21st January 2010, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) released a statement advising the suspension of sibutramine following a study which showed that there was an increased risk of non-fatal heart attacks and strokes outweighing the benefits of this weight loss drug. Therefore, data on Sibutramine will be limited for 2010-2012.",,,,,,,,,,,
"9. Mazindol  is not found in the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) obesity guidance or in the BNF guidance.  This suggests there are no UK recommendations for its use. “The PACT system uses the therapeutic classifications defined in the British National Formulary (BNF). No information on why a drug is prescribed is available and as drugs can be prescribed to treat more than one condition it is impossible to separate the different conditions that a drug was prescribed for.”  NHS Prescription services have coded Mazindol within BNF section 4.5 Drugs used in the treatment of obesity, but as prescription data has no information as to why it was prescribed it cannot be stated it was definitely used for the treatment of obesity in this instance. Consequently Mazindol has been excluded, the number of data items affected is very small and does not have a major effect on the totals overall.
