1,"A finished admission episode (FAE) is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FAEs are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and 7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,ICD-10 Codes: E66 - Obesity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,"Counts include people resident in English Regions only, including admissions where the Region of residence was England but not further specified and excludes admissions where the Region of residence was unknown.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,The quality and coverage of HES data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"The Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) data presented are for inpatients only, and so does not reflect all hospital activity. This should be considered when interpreting the data as practice may vary over time and between regions. In particular, practices vary between hospitals as to whether some episodes are carried out or recorded in outpatient or inpatient settings and any changes in recording and clinical practice can affect the trends presented in this report. Outpatient procedures are not included in these figures due to the primary diagnosis code being poorly populated, and there being no certainty that procedures are for obesity diagnoses.  One provider in particular, Derby Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust recorded 183 inpatient admissions in 2013/14 with a primary diagnosis of obesity compared to 920 inpatient admissions in 2012/13 which is a large part of the decrease seen on the national figures (down 1,632).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"A finished admission episode (FAE) is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FAEs are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and 7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,ICD-10 Codes: E66 - Obesity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,"Counts include people resident in English Regions only, including admissions where the Region of residence was England but not further specified and excludes admissions where the Region of residence was unknown.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6,Totals include admissions where the gender was unknown or not specified.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,* in this table means a figure between 1 and 5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"The Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) data presented are for inpatients only, and so does not reflect all hospital activity. This should be considered when interpreting the data as practice may vary over time and between regions. In particular, practices vary between hospitals as to whether some episodes are carried out or recorded in outpatient or inpatient settings and any changes in recording and clinical practice can affect the trends presented in this report. Outpatient procedures are not included in these figures due to the primary diagnosis code being poorly populated, and there being no certainty that procedures are for obesity diagnoses.  One provider in particular, Derby Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust recorded 183 inpatient admissions in 2013/14 with a primary diagnosis of obesity compared to 920 inpatient admissions in 2012/13 which is a large part of the decrease seen on the national figures (down 1,632).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"A finished admission episode (FAE) is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FAEs are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and 7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,ICD-10 Codes: E66 - Obesity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,"Counts include people resident in English Regions only, including admissions where the Region of residence was England but not further specified and excludes admissions where the Region of residence was unknown.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,"Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated resident population mid-2013 figures have been used to calculate admissions per 100,000 population.  Information on ONS population data is available at: ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6,Totals include admissions where the gender was unknown or not specified.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,* in this table means a figure between 1 and 5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"The Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) data presented are for inpatients only, and so does not reflect all hospital activity. This should be considered when interpreting the data as practice may vary over time and between regions. In particular, practices vary between hospitals as to whether some episodes are carried out or recorded in outpatient or inpatient settings and any changes in recording and clinical practice can affect the trends presented in this report. Outpatient procedures are not included in these figures due to the primary diagnosis code being poorly populated, and there being no certainty that procedures are for obesity diagnoses.  One provider in particular, Derby Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust recorded 183 inpatient admissions in 2013/14 with a primary diagnosis of obesity compared to 920 inpatient admissions in 2012/13 which is a large part of the decrease seen on the national figures (down 1,632).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 19 (13 from 2002/03 to 2006/07 and 6 prior to 2002/03) secondary diagnosis fields in Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.

5,The quality and coverage of HES data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. This may be particularly relevant for admissions with a primary or secondary diagnosis where some of the increases may be attributable to changes in recording practice. Further years data may be required to aid interpretation of these statistics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"The Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) data presented are for inpatients only, and so does not reflect all hospital activity. This should be considered when interpreting the data as practice may vary over time and between regions. In particular, practices vary between hospitals as to whether some episodes are carried out or recorded in outpatient or inpatient settings and any changes in recording and clinical practice can affect the trends presented in this report. Outpatient episodes are not included in these figures due to the primary diagnosis code being poorly populated, and there being no certainty that episodes are for obesity diagnoses.

1,"A finished admission episode (FAE) is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FAEs are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002/03 to 2006/07 and 7 prior to 2002/03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital. As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 19 (13 from 2002/03 to 2006/07 and 6 prior to 2002/03) secondary diagnosis fields in Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care. These figures represent the number of episodes where the diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 primary and secondary diagnosis fields in the record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if the diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,ICD-10 Codes: E66 - Obesity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,"Counts include people resident in English Regions only, including admissions where the Region of residence was England but not further specified and excludes admissions where the Region of residence was unknown.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,"Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated resident population mid-2013 figures have been used to calculate admissions per 100,000 population.  Information on ONS population data is available at: ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pop-estimate/population-estimates-for-uk--england-and-wales--scotland-and-northern-ireland/2013/stb---mid-2013-uk-population-estimates.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,Totals include admissions where the gender was unknown or not specified.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,The quality and coverage of HES data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. This may be particularly relevant for admissions with a primary or secondary diagnosis where some of the increases may be attributable to changes in recording practice. Further years data may be required to aid interpretation of these statistics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"The Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) data presented are for inpatients only, and so does not reflect all hospital activity. This should be considered when interpreting the data as practice may vary over time and between regions. In particular, practices vary between hospitals as to whether some episodes are carried out or recorded in outpatient or inpatient settings and any changes in recording and clinical practice can affect the trends presented in this report. Outpatient episodes are not included in these figures due to the primary diagnosis code being poorly populated, and there being no certainty that episodes are for obesity diagnoses.

FAEs are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002/03 to 2006/07 and 7 prior to 2002/03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital. As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 19 (13 from 2002/03 to 2006/07 and 6 prior to 2002/03) secondary diagnosis fields in Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care. These figures represent the number of episodes where the diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 primary and secondary diagnosis fields in the record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if the diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,The quality and coverage of HES data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. This may be particularly relevant for admissions with a primary or secondary diagnosis where some of the increases may be attributable to changes in recording practice. Further years data may be required to aid interpretation of these statistics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"The Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) data presented are for inpatients only, and so does not reflect all hospital activity. This should be considered when interpreting the data as practice may vary over time and between regions. In particular, practices vary between hospitals as to whether some episodes are carried out or recorded in outpatient or inpatient settings and any changes in recording and clinical practice can affect the trends presented in this report. Outpatient episodes are not included in these figures due to the primary diagnosis code being poorly populated, and there being no certainty that episodes are for obesity diagnoses.

1,"A finished consultant episode (FCE) is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and 7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,ICD-10 Codes: E66 - Obesity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,"These figures represent the number of episodes where the procedure (or intervention) was recorded in any of the 24 (12 from 2002/03 to 2006/07 and 4 prior to 2002/03) operative procedure fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. A record is only included once in each count, even if the procedure is recorded in more than one operative procedure field of the record. Please note that more procedures are carried out than episodes with a main or secondary procedure.  For example, patients under going a cataract operation would tend to have at least two procedures  removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new one  counted in a single episode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,"The term 'bariatric surgery' is often used to define a group of procedures that can be performed to facilitate weight loss although these procedures can be performed for conditions other than weight loss.  It includes stomach stapling, gastric bypasses, gastric band maintenance and sleeve gastrectomy. The procedures for tables 7.9 to 7.12  show the defined range of procedures when a corresponding main diagnosis of Obesity (ICD10-E66) is also present. Definition of codes can be found in Appendix B.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"From 2012/13 the list of OPCS 4.6 codes used to define bariatric surgery has been amended in line with the methodology used by Health Resource Groups (HRGs) this is covered in more detail in the Methodological Change Note http://www.hscic.gov.uk/media/13556/Statistics-on-Obesity-Physical-Activity-and-Diet-England-2014/pdf/MethChange201402_SOPAD.pdf 
This definitional change has a minimal effect on previous years data; between 20 and 30 cases a year from 2009/10 onwards when OPCS 4.5 and 4.6 codes were used, following on from the introduction of a specific code for maintenance of gastric band in OPCS-4.5 in 2009/10. All OPCS-4.2, OPCS-4.3, OPCS-4.4, OPCS-4.5 and OPCS-4.6 procedure codes used to define bariatric surgery are described in Appendix B.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"Counts include people resident in English Regions only, including admissions where the Region of residence was England but not further specified and excludes admissions where the Region of residence was unknown.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"Office for National Statistics (ONS estimated resident population mid-2013 figures have been used to calculate FCEs per 100,000 population.  Information on ONS population data is available at: ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,* in this table means a figure between 1 and 5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"The Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) data presented are for inpatients only, and so does not reflect all hospital activity. This should be considered when interpreting the data as practice may vary over time and between regions. In particular, practices vary between hospitals as to whether some episodes are carried out or recorded in outpatient or inpatient settings and any changes in recording and clinical practice can affect the trends presented in this report. Outpatient procedures are not included in these figures due to the primary diagnosis code being poorly populated, and there being no certainty that procedures are for obesity diagnoses.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"One provider in particular, Derby Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust recorded a decrease of 739 inpatient bariatric surgical procedures in 2013/14 mainly due to gastric band maintenance procedures which is a large part of the decrease seen on the national figures (down 1,640).   This Trust has also recorded 594 procedures in outpatient settings in 2013/14 with a primary procedure code of gastric band maintenance compared to none in 2012/13.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"A finished consultant episode (FCE) is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and 7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4,"These figures represent the number of episodes where the procedure (or intervention) was recorded in any of the 24 (12 from 2002/03 to 2006/07 and 4 prior to 2002/03) operative procedure fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. A record is only included once in each count, even if the procedure is recorded in more than one operative procedure field of the record. Please note that more procedures are carried out than episodes with a main or secondary procedure.  For example, patients under going a cataract operation would tend to have at least two procedures  removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new one  counted in a single episode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,"The term 'bariatric surgery' is often used to define a group of procedures that can be performed to facilitate weight loss although these procedures can be performed for conditions other than weight loss.  It includes stomach stapling, gastric bypasses, gastric band maintenance and sleeve gastrectomy. The procedures for tables 7.9 to 7.12  show the defined range of procedures when a corresponding main diagnosis of Obesity (ICD10-E66) is also present. Definition of codes can be found in Appendix B.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,From 2012/13 the list of OPCS 4.6 codes used to define bariatric surgery has been amended in line with the methodology used by Health Resource Groups (HRGs) this is covered in more detail in the Methodological Change Note,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"This definitional change has a minimal effect on previous years data; between 20 and 30 cases a year from 2009/10 onwards when OPCS 4.5 and 4.6 codes were used, following on from the introduction of a specific code for maintenance of gastric band in OPCS-4.5 in 2009/10. All OPCS-4.2, OPCS-4.3, OPCS-4.4, OPCS-4.5 and OPCS-4.6 procedure codes used to define bariatric surgery are described in Appendix B.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,The quality and coverage of HES data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,"The Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) data presented are for inpatients only, and so does not reflect all hospital activity. This should be considered when interpreting the data as practice may vary over time and between regions. In particular, practices vary between hospitals as to whether some episodes are carried out or recorded in outpatient or inpatient settings and any changes in recording and clinical practice can affect the trends presented in this report. Outpatient procedures are not included in these figures due to the primary diagnosis code being poorly populated, and there being no certainty that procedures are for obesity diagnoses.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"One provider in particular, Derby Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust recorded a decrease of 739 inpatient bariatric surgical procedures in 2013/14 mainly due to gastric band maintenance procedures which is a large part of the decrease seen on the national figures (down 1,640).   This Trust has also recorded 594 procedures in outpatient settings in 2013/14 with a primary procedure code of gastric band maintenance compared to none in 2012/13.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No information on why a drug is prescribed is available and as drugs can be prescribed to treat more than one condition it is impossible to separate the different conditions that a drug was prescribed for.  NHS Prescription services have coded Mazindol within BNF section 4.5 Drugs used in the treatment of obesity, but as prescription data has no information as to why it was prescribed it cannot be stated it was definitely used for the treatment of obesity in this instance. Consequently Mazindol has been excluded, the number of data items affected is very small and does not have a major effect on the totals overall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,"Sub National Presentation of Prescribing Data Following NHS Reforms
The Health and Social Care Act 2012 outlines a number of changes to the NHS, which took effect from 1 April 2013. Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) and Strategic Health Authorities (SHAs) were abolished and their functions were replaced by Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) and Area Teams (AT).

Prescribing information is not comparable between PCTs and CCGs as there are some differences in the individual populations they serve and the organisations have different functions. For example, the costs of community nurse prescribing used to be charged to PCTs but this is now allocated to either, Local Authorities, Trusts or Area Teams as either providers or commissioners of that service. Therefore some data which used to be included in a PCT total will not be included in a CCG total; but elsewhere, in a total for a non-CCG organisation. Although mapping between PCTs and CCGs is possible, it would be potentially misleading for us to provide time series data for PCTs and CCGs.

Where prescribing data is required at a sub-national level, both before and after April 2013, providing information at the Area Team level is more appropriate. At this level the PCTs can be mapped more successfully to the Area Teams. This mapping has been carried out using codes from the NHS Organisation Data Service (ODS) and the boundaries of lower layer super output areas from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). 

There are five PCTs split across one or more Area Team but in each case at least 93 per cent of the PCT population appears in one specific Area Team; where this occurs the PCT has been allocated to that specific Area Team.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Prescriptions for closed organisations
Prescription data may be attributed to organisations which have since closed. Prescriptions can be presented for dispensing up to six months after issue, so an issuing organisation may have closed before a prescription is dispensed.
