"1.  A finished admission episode (FAE) is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FAEs are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.",,,,,,,,,
"2.  The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002/03 to 2006/07 and 7 prior to 2002/03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital. As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 19 (13 from 2002/03 to 2006/07 and 6 prior to 2002/03) secondary diagnosis fields in Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care. These figures represent the number of episodes where the diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 primary and secondary diagnosis fields in the record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if the diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.",,,,,,,,,

8. The quality and coverage of HES data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. This may be particularly relevant for admissions with a primary or secondary diagnosis where some of the increases may be attributable to changes in recording practice. Further years data may be required to aid interpretation of these statistics.,,,,,,,,,

"1. A finished consultant episode (FCE) is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.",,,

A record is only included once in each count, even if the procedure is recorded in more than one operative procedure field of the record. Please note that more procedures are carried out than episodes with a main or secondary procedure.  For example, patients under going a cataract operation would tend to have at least two procedures  removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new one  counted in a single episode.",,,
"5. The term 'bariatric surgery' is often used to define a group of procedures that can be performed to facilitate weight loss although these procedures can be performed for conditions other than weight loss.  It includes stomach stapling, gastric bypasses and sleeve gastrectomy. The procedures for tables 7.12 and 7.13  show the defined range of procedures when a corresponding main diagnosis of Obesity (ICD10-E66) is also present. Definition of codes can be found in Appendix B.",,,

Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.,,,
"11. Figures are based on decisions as to which operative procedures constituted 'Bariatric Surgery' at that time. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years). In particular, improvements in how 'Bariatric surgery' is coded, with the change of codes in various versions of OPCS, means that had the previous years been based on the latest coding advice, figures would have been slightly different and affects earlier years more.",,,
"12. Hospital coding for bariatric surgery was updated in 2009/10 so that it is now possible to identify how many bariatric procedures were for maintenance of an existing gastric band. Nationally, of the 8,087 bariatric procedures in 2010/11, 1,444 of these were for maintenance.",,,
