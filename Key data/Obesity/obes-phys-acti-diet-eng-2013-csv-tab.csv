"1.  A finished admission episode (FAE) is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FAEs are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.  The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and 7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3.  ICD-10 Codes: E66 - Obesity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4.  Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5.  Counts include people resident in English Strategic Health Authorites (SHAs) only, including admissions where the SHA of residence was England but not further specified and excludes admissions where the SHA of residence was unknown.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
6. Total includes admissions where the gender was unknown.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7. The quality and coverage of HES data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"8. Practices vary between hospitals as to whether some bariatric procedures are carried out in outpatient or inpatient settings. This may particularly be the case for maintenance procedures. OPCS-4.5 introduced a specific code for maintenance of gastric band. OPCS-4.5 was introduced in 2009/10. Use of this code may have contributed to the increase seen from this year. The data presented in this report are for inpatients only, so may not reflect all hospital activity. This should be considered when interpreting the data as practice may vary over time and between regions. See Appendix A for further detail on HES.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and 7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These figures represent the number of episodes where the procedure (or intervention) was recorded in any of the 24 (12 from 2002/03 to 2006/07 and 4 prior to 2002/03) operative procedure fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. A record is only included once in each count, even if the procedure is recorded in more than one operative procedure field of the record. Please note that more procedures are carried out than episodes with a main or secondary procedure.  For example, patients under going a ‘cataract operation’ would tend to have at least two procedures – removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new one – counted in a single episode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5. The term 'bariatric surgery' is often used to define a group of procedures that can be performed to facilitate weight loss although these procedures can be performed for conditions other than weight loss.  It includes stomach stapling, gastric bypasses and sleeve gastrectomy. The procedures for tables 7.7 and 7.8  show the defined range of procedures when a corresponding main diagnosis of Obesity (ICD10-E66) is also present. Definition of codes can be found in Appendix B.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

9. Total includes episodes where the gender was unknown.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10. The quality and coverage of HES data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"11. Figures before 2009-10 were based on decisions as to which operative procedures constituted 'Bariatric Surgery' at that time. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years). In particular, improvements in how 'Bariatric surgery' is coded, with the change of codes in various versions of OPCS, means that had the previous years been based on OPCS-4.5, figures would have been slightly lower and affects earlier years more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12. Practices vary between hospitals as to whether some bariatric procedures are carried out in outpatient or inpatient settings. This may particularly be the case for maintenance procedures. OPCS-4.5 introduced a specific code for maintenance of gastric band. OPCS-4.5 was introduced in 2009/10. Use of this code may have contributed to the increase seen from this year.

"1.  A finished consultant episode (FCE) is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and 7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. ICD-10 Codes: E66 - Obesity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4. These figures represent the number of episodes where the procedure (or intervention) was recorded in any of the 24 (12 from 2002/03 to 2006/07 and 4 prior to 2002/03) operative procedure fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. A record is only included once in each count, even if the procedure is recorded in more than one operative procedure field of the record. Please note that more procedures are carried out than episodes with a main or secondary procedure.  For example, patients under going a ‘cataract operation’ would tend to have at least two procedures – removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new one – counted in a single episode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5. The term 'bariatric surgery' is often used to define a group of procedures that can be performed to facilitate weight loss although these procedures can be performed for conditions other than weight loss.  It includes stomach stapling, gastric bypasses and sleeve gastrectomy. The procedures for tables 7.12 and 7.13  show the defined range of procedures when a corresponding main diagnosis of Obesity (ICD10-E66) is also present. Definition of codes can be found in Appendix B.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6. All OPCS-4.2, OPCS-4.3, OPCS-4.4, OPCS-4.5 and OPCS-4.6 procedure codes used to define bariatric surgery are described in Appendix B.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
7. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"8. Counts include people resident in English Strategic Health Authorites (SHA) only, including admissions where the SHA of residence was England but not further specified and excludes admissions where the SHA of residence was unknown.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"9. Office for National Statistics (ONS estimated resident population mid-2011 figures have been used to calculate FCEs per 100,000 population.  Information on ONS population data is available at: ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pop-estimate/population-estimates-for-england-and-wales/mid-2011--2011-census-based-/index.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10. Totals include episodes where the gender was unknown.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11.  * in this table means a figure between 1 and 5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12. Practices vary between hospitals as to whether some bariatric procedures are carried out in outpatient or inpatient settings. This may particularly be the case for maintenance procedures. OPCS-4.5 introduced a specific code for maintenance of gastric band. OPCS-4.5 was introduced in 2009/10. Use of this code may have contributed to the increase seen from this year. The data presented in this report are for inpatients only, so may not reflect all hospital activity. This should be considered when interpreting the data as practice may vary over time and between regions. See Appendix A for further detail on HES.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,

On 21st January 2010, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) released a statement advising the suspension of sibutramine following a study which showed that there was an increased risk of non-fatal heart attacks and strokes outweighing the benefits of this weight loss drug. Therefore, data on Sibutramine will be limited for 2010.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
