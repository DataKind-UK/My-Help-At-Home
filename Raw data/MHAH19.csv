the source of funding grants.
The primary objective of the Company is to offer a subsidised service to the 
disadvantaged and vulnerable, particularly older people. The business model it employs 
enables subsidised work to be financed from a mixture of grants and cross-subsidy 
gained from its non-subsidised domestic and commercial customers. In 2005 Helping
Hands secured a contract with Salford City Council to carry out Priority works to the 
elderly and vulnerable people of Salford. This work is completed at no charge to our 
client group, this is funded through the City Council, the works involve making our
client group feel more secure in their homes and goes some way towards the upkeep

older people who look after their wives/husbands and therefore as our
service is flexible, some will come together, some (be they carers or Cared
for) come alone.
1- Free door to door transport (this is not funded by the Carers Grant) to
attend Day Centre twice a week as well as benefit from activities/services
taking place at the Day Centre. As a result , the above provision benefits 
both for Carers and those cared for in different ways.

as we provide lunch for those being cared for, opportunity for cared for the
socialise with their peers, take part in mild forms of exercises, benefit
from health promotional and cultural events,etc. Sometimes its the other way round. 
The Carer attends the Day Centre and has a break by socialising with other Carers, 
take part in mild forms of exercises, benefit from health promotional, recreational
and cultural events,etc. Some carers will purchase lunch for the person they
care for as there is no Armenian meals on Wheels. In some cases both the
Carer and Cared for person will come together but enjoy themselves
separately, even if they are married,etc. 
Carers have also attended our Silver Surfer sessions in the past year
enabling them not only to have a break but develop themselves.
2- Home visits/breaks at home

accessed needs of cared for person and where appropriate provided
independent advice and advocacy services to them in their own language.
3- Seaside outing for both, these being cared for and for Carers. Some
Carers chose not to come to have a break, so we took those being looked
after. For some Carers it was the other way round. They chose to come and
made arrangements for someone else to look after the person they normally

2010/11,816,Brighton and Hove UA,30,Telelink/Carelink Plus,,"This service has expanded in the last year and we have based our figures on the following information: 
The service reported that it had:
16 new referrals in the survey week
31 Installs
On top of this the service had 4117 calls for support; the service used their call management system to break down the call data for us to ensure that we were not counting people twice. This amounted to 869 individual people. Then next step was that we needed to deduct those people that would have a package of care. Based on information from a recent CSED report which estimated that 28% of the people that the service supports had a package of care. We then deducted 28% from the 869 people which gave us a total of 679. 
This in total gave us the 726 reported.
The calls the service deals with can be varied and this requires a range of involvement from the team. For example, this could include clients who have had fall, so staff might visit the client to make sure they are safe or they might need to then arrange help for them or organise an ambulance. The service gets involved in ensuring that the person has support in their home a number of the services clients have dementia.

Where mentoring services are delivered to older people within this Agreement they will be provided as described in D4.1 above; but the core components of this Service are described below. The Service will undertake an exercise to map minority ethnic services and community groups to discover what support mechanisms are in place and where they are located;
Local communities and the statutory sector will be approached to ascertain whether their provision is appropriate;
Where local service provision is not available, or that which is available is not felt to be appropriate, then mentors will set up groups for those individuals who have been identified as meeting the criteria and who wish to be involved;
The Service will endeavour to create new social links and to develop wider social networks for older BME people in the areas of Devon in which the Service is provided;
The Service will develop and populate a database of social opportunities for older BME people in the areas in which the Service operates;
The Service will identify those individuals described within this Agreement who meet the criteria for a mentoring service and will appoint sufficient numbers of Mentors to work with those individuals;
The Service Provider will report periodically throughout the project period of findings of service usage by Black and Minority Ethnic elders, barriers to such usage, and practical and sustainable means of overcoming these;
The Service Provider will undertake a service evaluation at individual and service level which will be conducted according to agreed protocols;
Following this evaluation of the Service and its component parts it will be determined whether the model is suitable and effectively engages with Black and Minority Ethnic Groups;
The Service Provider will assist with the development of a practical Manual or How To guide to inform future Service Providers.
During the term of the Agreement Providers will be expected to consider, and where possible to establish, arrangements to enhance value for money within the provision of the Service. This could include generating efficiencies by partnership working with other providers, services or voluntary sector organisations, the generation of additional resources from other resources which would complement the contracted services or, in the case of not-for-profit organisations, the use of volunteers to complement the role of paid staff.",X,40000,0,Y,19,11,-,0,Mental Health,N,A
